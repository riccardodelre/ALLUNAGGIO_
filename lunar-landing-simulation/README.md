# Lunar Landing Simulation

## Overview
The Lunar Landing Simulation is a web application designed to simulate the landing of a spacecraft on the Moon. Users can input the mass of the spacecraft and its initial velocity to calculate the time required for a successful landing. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the physics involved in lunar landings.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that provides the structure of the web application, including input fields and a button to perform calculations.
- **css/stile.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the application, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **js/script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the simulation, including the `calcolaTempo()` function that performs the calculations based on user input.
- **README.md**: This documentation file that provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Instructions for Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the mass of the spacecraft in kilograms (between 10 and 100,000 kg).
3. Enter the initial velocity in meters per second (between 1 and 1,000 m/s).
4. Click the "Calcola" button to calculate the time required for the lunar landing.
5. The result will be displayed below the input fields.

## Additional Information
This simulation is intended for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world physics accurately. Users are encouraged to experiment with different values to see how they affect the landing time.
